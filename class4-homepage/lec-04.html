        University of Scholars has started its journey in 2015 with five
        departments at the outset. The Trustee Board of the university aims to
        establish a research-intensive modern private university for Bangladeshi
        as well as international students which will produce world-class
        researchers and industry leading professionals. The university is
        working with the slogan- We Build Professionals, and following American
        curriculum with strong emphasis on the use of technology for teaching
        and learning process. Therefore, we are adopting the newest educational
        technologies (EdTech) to modernize our Learning Management System (LMS)
        for the best experience of learning as well as teaching. This is the
        first initiative of such kind in Bangladesh. Our congenial atmosphere
        and flexible policy inspire the faculty members who are highly qualified
        having academic degrees and professional training from home and abroad.
